ROOF TAXONOMY

1. Thatch - Elements are very small and semi ridged.

2. Green / Vegetative - Elements are small and non-uniform. Modern category where a layer of soil and vegetation is placed over a waterproof membrane. It could be considered an extension of thatch, but it functions differently.

3. Limestone Slates - Elements are small and ridged.

4. Stone Slates - Elements are small and ridged.

5. Clay Tiles - Elements are small and ridged.

6. Asphalt Tiles - Elements are small and ridged.

7. Concrete Tiles - Elements are small and ridged.

8. Wood Tiles - Elements are small and ridged.

9. Metal Sheet Materials - Elements are large and either ridged a corrugated with vertical and horizontal overlaps; or flexible and laid in large panels.

10. Polycarbonate Sheet Materials - Elements are large and either ridged a corrugated with vertical and horizontal overlaps; or flexible and laid in large panels. Clear or painted. 

11. Glass Sheet Materials – Some modern / high-end structures incorporate glass as a primary roofing material, which differs from polycarbonate sheets in transparency, durability, and application.

12. Amorphous Concrete - Single element covering entire roof without joints.

13. Amorphous Asphalt - Single element covering entire roof without joints.

14. Amorphous Membrane - Single element covering entire roof without joints. Includes materials like EPDM (rubber roofing), TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin), and PVC (polyvinyl chloride), which are commonly used for flat or low-slope roofs.

15. Amorphous Fabric (Tensile Structures) - Single element covering entire roof without joints. Some large-span structures use fabric-based membranes (e.g., PTFE-coated fiberglass or ETFE) stretched over a frame.


CLASSES I AM UNSURE ABOUT

Composite or Synthetic Roofing – Many modern roofing materials are made from recycled plastics, rubber, or a mix of materials designed to mimic natural materials like slate or wood while offering increased durability. I don't know if this can be discerned from satellite imagery.
