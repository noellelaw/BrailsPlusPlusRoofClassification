Examples
========

A series of examples is provided as documentation for |app|. These examples are organized progressively, building on concepts introduced in previous examples to deepen understanding step-by-step. Each example presents one or more Python scripts, explaining their inputs and discussing the outputs generated by running the scripts. While the examples focus on key outputs, they represent only a subset of the information produced. Since |app| primarily focuses on creating regional inventories, several Jupyter notebooks are included to display interactive maps, providing insights into the larger inventories generated.
